## Invincible Braves-Home Field Magic?
The home field advantage is the edge which a team may have when playing a game at its home stadium. For example, it is the edge the Braves may have over the Yankees when the head-to-head match-up is in Atlanta. It is the advantage the Yankees may have when the head-to-head match-up is in New York.

![The Braves aren’t surprising anyone this season. They’re just beating everyone.](C:\Users\user\Desktop\Braves.png)

## Let's Start! (Assumptions)
* Suppose that the Braves and the Yankees are teams competing in the World Series.

* The table below has the two possible schedules for each game of the series. (NYC = New York City, ATL = Atlanta)


Overall Advantage | Game 1 | Game 2 | Game 3 | Game 4 | Game 5 | Game 6 | Game 7 
---------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Braves   | ATL| ATL| NYC| NYC| NYC| ATL| ATL
Yankees  | NYC| NYC| ATL| ATL| ATL| NYC| NYC

* Let $\ P_{B}$be the probability that the Braves win a single head-to-head match-up with the Yankees, under the assumption that home field advantage doesn’t exist. Let $\ P_{B}^H$denote the probability that the Braves win a single head-to-head match-up with the Yankees as the home team (H for home). Let $\ P_{B}^A$denote the probability that the Braves win a single head-to-head match-up with the away team (A for away).

Game Location | No Advantage | Advantage 
---------|---------|--------------------------------
ATL      |$\ P_{B}$| $\ P_{B}^H$=$\ P_{B}$*1.1
NYC      |$\ P_{B}$| $\ P_{B}^A$=1-(1-$\ P_{B}$)*1.1

# With/wihtout home advantage 
Here is the probability without home field advantage that the Braves win the world series when $\ P_{B}$ =0.55.  

```{r}
pbinom(3,7,0.45)
1-pbinom(3,7,0.45)
```
The probability without home field advantage that Braves win the world series is 0.608

Here is the probability with home field advantage that the Braves win the world series when the sequence of game locations is {NYC, NYC, ATL, ATL, ATL, NYC, NYC} and $\ P_{B}$ =0.55.  

```{r cache=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
require(data.table)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

# Get all possible outcomes
apo <- data.table::fread("all-possible-world-series-outcomes.csv")
View(apo)

# Home field indicator
hfi <- c(0,0,1,1,1,0,0) #{NYC, NYC, ALT, ALT, ALT, NYC, NYC}

# P_B
pb <- 0.55
advantage_multiplier <- 1.1 # Set = 1 for no advantage
pbh <- 0.55*advantage_multiplier
pba <- 1 - (1 - 0.55)*advantage_multiplier

# Calculate the probability of each possible outcome
apo[, p := NA_real_] # Initialize new column in apo to store prob
for(i in 1:nrow(apo)){
  prob_game <- rep(1, 7)
  for(j in 1:7){
    p_win <- ifelse(hfi[j], pbh, pba)
    prob_game[j] <- case_when(
        apo[i,j,with=FALSE] == "W" ~ p_win
      , apo[i,j,with=FALSE] == "L" ~ 1 - p_win
      , TRUE ~ 1
    )
  }
  apo[i, p := prod(prob_game)] # Data.table syntax
}

# Sanity check: does sum(p) == 1?
apo[, sum(p)] # This is data.table notation

# Probability of overall World Series outcomes
apo[, sum(p), overall_outcome]
```
The probability with home field advantage that Braves win the world series is 0.604

In conclusion, the probability between with home advantage and without home field advantage are diffrent. Based on the assumption we made above, the probability without home field advantage that Braves win the world series is 0.608 which is greater than 0.604 the probability with home field advantage. The difference is 0.004. 


# Simulation (with/without home advantage)
Here is the probability without home field advantage that the Braves win the world series when $\ P_{B}$ =0.55 by simulation.

```{r cache=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
hfi <- c(0,0,1,1,1,0,0)
pb <- 0.55
game <- rep(NA, 100000)
for(i in 1:100000){
  result<- rep(NA,7)
  for (j in 1:7){
    result[j]<-rbinom(1,1,pb)
    if (sum(result,na.rm = TRUE)==4){
      game[i]="win"
    break
  }
  else if (length(which(result==0))==4){
    game[i] = "lose"
break
}
else
next
}
}

p_hat_without<-mean(game=="win")
p_hat_without

```
The probability without home field advantage that Braves win the world series by simulation is 0.608.


Here is the probability with home field advantage that the Braves win the world series when the sequence of game locations is {NYC, NYC, ATL, ATL, ATL, NYC, NYC} and $\ P_{B}$ =0.55.  

```{r cache=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
pb <- 0.55
advantage_multiplier <- 1.1 
pbh <- 0.55*advantage_multiplier
pba <- 1 - (1 - 0.55)*advantage_multiplier
hfi <- c(0,0,1,1,1,0,0)




j = 0
Win_game <- rep(NA, 100000)
round <- hfi
for(i in seq_along(Win_game)){
  for (k in seq_along(hfi)){
    p_win<-ifelse(hfi[k],pbh,pba)
    round[k]<- rbinom(1,1,p_win)
  }
  #Win_game[i]
  if (sum(round)>=4){
    Win_game[i] <- 1
  }
  else{
    Win_game[i] <- 0 
 }
}

p_hat_with<- mean(Win_game)
p_hat_with
```
The probability with home field advantage that Braves win the world series by simulation is 0.605.

Use two different if else conditions to deal with the simulation. In simulation, the probability without home field advantage that Braves win the world series by simulation is 0.608 while the probability with the home field advantage is 0.605. The difference of probability between them is 0.003 in simulation method. 


# Absolute and relative error for simulation 

Here is the formula for absolute error and relative error

absolute error = |p̂−p|

and

relative error = |p̂−p|/p.

```{r}
pb_with<-0.604221
pb_without<-0.6082878
abs_error_without<- abs(pb_without-p_hat_without)
rel_error_without<- abs(pb_without-p_hat_without)/pb_without
abs_error_with<- abs(pb_with-p_hat_with)
rel_error_with<- abs(pb_with-p_hat_with)/pb_with
abs_error_without
rel_error_without
abs_error_with
rel_error_with
```
The absolute error without home field advantage is 0.057
The relative error without home field advantage is 0.094
The absolute error with home field advantage is 0.002
The relative error with home field advantage is 0.003

# Conlusion 

* When we are calculating probability in real life, it is not always equal likely as theoretical assumption. For example, in real life we should computer the home advantage to close to the true probability. When your simulation is large enough the error will be small.
